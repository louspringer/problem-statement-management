# Problem Statement Management

## Overview

Welcome to the Problem Statement Management repository! This project serves as a centralized resource for architects, engineers, and technical stakeholders involved in problem management processes. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive guide, tools, scripts, and descriptions of techniques essential for effective problem management.

## Purpose

Problems are critical configuration items (CI) in a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), similar to other artifacts like code. A well-defined problem can catalyze multiple iterations of work, driving solutions over many months. This repository not only hosts the Problem Statement Creation Guide but also aims to expand into a detailed repository of tools and techniques for managing complex technical problems effectively.

## Audience

This repository is designed for:

- **Architects**: Offering strategic guidance and frameworks to tackle enterprise-wide issues.
- **Engineers**: Providing practical tools and scripts to manage and resolve problems efficiently.
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Involved in problem management processes or those providing domain-specific support for various problem classes.

## Repository Contents

- [**Problem Statement Creation Guide**](Problem_Statement_Creation_Guide.md): A foundational document that outlines how to articulate and manage problems effectively.
- **Tools and Scripts**: Practical resources to facilitate problem management and resolution.
- **Techniques**: Descriptions and guidelines on advanced problem management techniques used in specific domains.

## Commitment to Quality

Problems, like any CI in a CMDB, require meticulous attention and management. Our repository aims to uphold the highest standards of quality and reliability in problem management, ensuring that each problem is addressed with the due diligence it deserves.

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcome! Whether it's refining the guides, expanding the toolkit, or sharing new problem management strategies, your input is invaluable. Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to make contributions.
